<h2>Brief Background</h2>
Traditional student management systems that are still somewhat used in Indonesia are still in the form of paper-based systems. Based on our experience and research online, the use of paper-based student data management systems tends to be lacking in terms of efficiency and consistency compared to the more modern digital data management systems. These issues would eventually lead to several problems that could affect the performance of both students and teachers in the school. Read more in the report

<h2>Program Description</h2>
We created a digitalized student data management system that teachers could use to replace the old and traditional student data management system. All of the code is made completely using only the Java programming language. While there are a total of three different codes, all of the system has the same features, that is to allow users to store and manage student data by adding, removing, searching, viewing, and filtering students based on their final scores. 

<h2>Conclusion of this experiment</h2>
So, in conclusion to look at the very best or suitable data structure in terms of our experiments and theory of existent experiments and approach from the surfaces. Seems like we have to taken different approach from our previous presentation, from choosing LinkedList into HashMap data structure.

But we are talking about overall conclusion, because HashMap compare to other data structure having better time performance in terms of Linear Search and other common operations. But if we take memory or space performance as our priority we would choose LinkedList. But LinkedList is not suitable as it takes too long to operate the common operations.
